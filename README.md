This is sample website that showcases the usage of the CSS3 Flexbox. In the 1990's a tough task for web developers was creating columns of equal height. Web developers has to rely on the html "table" element to achieve columns of equal height in rows. This was often much more verbose, and generally a bad practice. CSS3 takes care of that with various layouts, including the Flexbox layout. Flexbox is valuable because you can achieve columns of equal height in rows directly from CSS. This is valuable because it is less verbose than html tables, and it makes responsive mobile web design much easier. ![SAMPLE SITE](sikudabo/Flexbox-Practice/sample-page.png)
